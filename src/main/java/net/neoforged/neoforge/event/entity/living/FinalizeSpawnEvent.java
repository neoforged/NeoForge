 * In vanilla code, this event is injected by a transformer and not via patch, so calls cannot be traced via call hierarchy (it is not source-visible).
 * <p>
 * Canceling this event will result in {@link Mob#finalizeSpawn} not being called, and the returned value always being null, instead of propagating the SpawnGroupData.<br>
 * The entity will still be spawned. If you want to prevent the spawn, use {@link FinalizeSpawnEvent#setSpawnCancelled}, which will cause Forge to prevent the spawn.
 * <p>
 * This event is fired on {@link NeoForge#EVENT_BUS}, and is only fired on the logical server.
 * 
 * @see EventHooks#onFinalizeSpawn
 * @apiNote Callers do not need to check if the entity's spawn was cancelled, as the spawn will be blocked by Forge.
