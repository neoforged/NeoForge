Contributing to NeoForge
=====================

1) Keep patches to Minecraft classes together. If you need a lot of things done, you may either add to relevant forge classes or make a new class. Try not to spread out your patches across multiple disjoint lines, as this makes maintenance of your patches difficult.

2) TODO: Test Mods

3) Follow the code style of the class you're working in (braces on newlines & spaces instead of tabs in Forge classes, inline brackets in patches, etc).

## Workflow

0. Have preliminary discussions on Discord (`#neoforge-github`)
1. Fork the repository
2. Check out your fork

4. Run `gradlew setup` from the project root
5. Import project into your IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse) or Reload Gradle Project
6. Make your changes, modify the decompiled Minecraft source-code as needed
7. Test your changes
   - Run the game (Runs are available in the IDE)
   - Run `gradlew :tests:runGameTestServer` or `Tests: GameTestServer` from IDE
   - Run `gradlew :tests:runGameTestClient` or `Tests: GameTestClient` from IDE
   - Check formatting with `gradlew spotlessCheck`
