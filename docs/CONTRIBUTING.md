 to NeoForge
=====================

1) Keep patches to Minecraft classes together. If you need a lot of things done, you may either add to relevant forge classes or make a new class. Try not to spread out your patches across multiple disjoint lines, as this makes maintenance of your patches difficult.

2) TODO: Test Mods

3) Follow the code style of the class you're working in (braces on newlines & spaces instead of tabs in Forge classes, inline brackets in patches, etc).

4) Sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/neoforged/NeoForge)

For more information, refer to [the wiki][Wiki].
