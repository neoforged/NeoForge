# Installing NeoForged

Go to [CurseForge][CurseForge] project, select the minecraft version and installer, and run it.

You can download the installer for the *Recommended Build* or the
 *Latest build* there. Latest builds may have newer features but may be
 more unstable as a result. The installer will attempt to install Forge
 into your vanilla launcher environment, where you can then create a new
 profile using that version and play the game!
 
For support and questions, visit [the NeoForged Discord server][Discord].

# Creating Mods

[See the "Getting Started" section in the NeoForged Documentation][Getting-Started].

# 1.20.2 and future versions

Since NeoForge started as a fork of Forge, a lot of things have to be changed/adjusted so we can properly continue the work.    
This sadly leads to a delay in newer mc version updates.    
But for transparency: [here](https://hackmd.io/@neoforged/SyPzw1Ryp) is a link for transparency that shows progress on how far we are with the work required to continue.
