## Installing NeoForged

Go to [CurseForge][CurseForge] project, select the minecraft version and installer, and run it.

You can download the installer for the *Recommended Build* or the
 *Latest build* there. Latest builds may have newer features but may be
 more unstable as a result. The installer will attempt to install Forge
 into your vanilla launcher environment, where you can then create a new
 profile using that version and play the game!
 
For support and questions, visit [the NeoForged Discord server][Discord].
